# Player_Movement

The first step is to open unity hub.
and make a project. you will need to name the project any name of your choice.
But for this tutorial i will call the project player movement.

When you open unity you will need to go to the scene 
button.

As seen in the picture I am on the scene button.
The next step is to make a platform for the player to walk on.

To make this you will go on the hierarchy, you right click on the hierarchy and you will go to 2d objects and spirte you can use squre as the player but i used a triangle
